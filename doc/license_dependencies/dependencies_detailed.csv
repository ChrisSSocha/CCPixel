color,1.6,MIT,"Color is a Ruby library to provide basic RGB, CMYK, HSL, and other colourspace manipulation support to applications that require it","Color is a Ruby library to provide basic RGB, CMYK, HSL, and other colourspace
manipulation support to applications that require it. It also provides 152
named RGB colours (184 with spelling variations) that are commonly supported in
HTML, SVG, and X11 applications. A technique for generating monochromatic
contrasting palettes is also included.

The Color library performs purely mathematical manipulation of the colours
based on colour theory without reference to colour profiles (such as sRGB or
Adobe RGB). For most purposes, when working with RGB and HSL colour spaces,
this won't matter. Absolute colour spaces (like CIE L*a*b* and XYZ) and cannot
be reliably converted to relative colour spaces (like RGB) without colour
profiles.

Color version 1.6 primarily adds a colour matching method for RGB and
experimental CIE L*a*b* and XYZ conversion methods for use with the colour
matching method.

Barring bugs introduced in this release, this is the last version of color that
supports Ruby 1.8, so make sure that your gem specification is set properly (to
<tt>~> 1.6</tt>) if that matters for your application."

rake,10.3.2,MIT,Rake is a Make-like program implemented in Ruby,"Rake is a Make-like program implemented in Ruby. Tasks and dependencies are
specified in standard Ruby syntax.

Rake has the following features:

* Rakefiles (rake's version of Makefiles) are completely defined in
  standard Ruby syntax.  No XML files to edit.  No quirky Makefile
  syntax to worry about (is that a tab or a space?)

* Users can specify tasks with prerequisites.

* Rake supports rule patterns to synthesize implicit tasks.

* Flexible FileLists that act like arrays but know about manipulating
  file names and paths.

* A library of prepackaged tasks to make building rakefiles easier. For example,
  tasks for building tarballs and publishing to FTP or SSH sites.  (Formerly
  tasks for building RDoc and Gems were included in rake but they're now
  available in RDoc and RubyGems respectively.)

* Supports parallel execution of tasks."
