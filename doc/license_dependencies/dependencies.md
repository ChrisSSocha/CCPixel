|Color is a Ruby library to provide basic RGB, CMYK, HSL, and other colourspace manipulation support to applications that require it|<a href='http://opensource.org/licenses/mit-license'>MIT</a>| Yes |


> Color is a Ruby library to provide basic RGB, CMYK, HSL, and other colourspace
> manipulation support to applications that require it. It also provides 152
> named RGB colours (184 with spelling variations) that are commonly supported in
> HTML, SVG, and X11 applications. A technique for generating monochromatic
> contrasting palettes is also included.
> 
> The Color library performs purely mathematical manipulation of the colours
> based on colour theory without reference to colour profiles (such as sRGB or
> Adobe RGB). For most purposes, when working with RGB and HSL colour spaces,
> this won't matter. Absolute colour spaces (like CIE L*a*b* and XYZ) and cannot
> be reliably converted to relative colour spaces (like RGB) without colour
> profiles.
> 
> Color version 1.6 primarily adds a colour matching method for RGB and
> experimental CIE L*a*b* and XYZ conversion methods for use with the colour
> matching method.
> 
> Barring bugs introduced in this release, this is the last version of color that
> supports Ruby 1.8, so make sure that your gem specification is set properly (to
> <tt>~> 1.6</tt>) if that matters for your application.

> Rake is a Make-like program implemented in Ruby. Tasks and dependencies are
> specified in standard Ruby syntax.
> 
> Rake has the following features:
> 
> * Rakefiles (rake's version of Makefiles) are completely defined in
>   standard Ruby syntax.  No XML files to edit.  No quirky Makefile
>   syntax to worry about (is that a tab or a space?)
> 
> * Users can specify tasks with prerequisites.
> 
> * Rake supports rule patterns to synthesize implicit tasks.
> 
> * Flexible FileLists that act like arrays but know about manipulating
>   file names and paths.
> 
> * A library of prepackaged tasks to make building rakefiles easier. For example,
>   tasks for building tarballs and publishing to FTP or SSH sites.  (Formerly
>   tasks for building RDoc and Gems were included in rake but they're now
>   available in RDoc and RubyGems respectively.)
> 
> * Supports parallel execution of tasks.
