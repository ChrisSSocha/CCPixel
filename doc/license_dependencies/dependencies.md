|Color is a Ruby library to provide basic RGB, CMYK, HSL, and other colourspace manipulation support to applications that require it|<a href='http://opensource.org/licenses/mit-license'>MIT</a>| Yes |


> Color is a Ruby library to provide basic RGB, CMYK, HSL, and other colourspace
> manipulation support to applications that require it. It also provides 152
> named RGB colours (184 with spelling variations) that are commonly supported in
> HTML, SVG, and X11 applications. A technique for generating monochromatic
> contrasting palettes is also included.
> 
> The capabilities of the Color library are limited to pure mathematical
> manipulation of the colours based on colour theory without reference to colour
> profiles (such as sRGB or Adobe RGB). For most purposes, when working with the
> RGB and HSL colours, this won't matter. However, some colour models (like CIE
> L*a*b*) are not supported because Color does not yet support colour profiles,
> giving no meaningful way to convert colours in absolute colour spaces (like
> L*a*b*, XYZ) to non-absolute colour spaces (like RGB).
> 
> Color version 1.5.1 is mostly a maintenance release, fixing some bugs that may
> have been introduced with the previous release on Ruby 1.8.7. New features
> include an experimental contrast comparison method for RGB colours (found in
> lib/color/rgb/contrast.rb) provided by Dave Heitzman, and methods suggested by
> Thomas Sawyer based on the Spectrum library.
> 
> Barring bugs introduced in this release, this will be the last version of color
> that supports Ruby 1.8, so make sure that your gem specification is set
> properly, to <tt>~> 1.5</tt> if that matters for your application.
